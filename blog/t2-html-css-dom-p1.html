  <h1>Thinking about HTML, CSS and DOM</h1>
  <<p>If I was to describe HTML, CSS and DOM I guess I would draw a comparsion to architecture. HTML is much like the framework and structure of a building. CSS is how that structure it utilised creatively, the colour of the walls, the features of the building, how it look aethetically. I think DOM is the way your code look within dev tools inside your browser...If we keep using the building comparison DOM would be how vistors to the building interact with the space, moving chairs around or something. Right? </p> 
  <br> Boxifying is the process of breaking down a website into box shapes. Sometimes the structure of websites is easier to understand when it break it up into seperate boxes of content. </br>
  <br> What is a box model? Is it not similar to my above explanation? </br>
